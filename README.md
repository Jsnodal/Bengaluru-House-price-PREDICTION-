# Bengaluru House Price Prediction
* his project focuses on predicting the prices of houses in Bengaluru, India, using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains various features of houses, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms, which are used to predict the price of a house. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate house prices based on these features.

* Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and others, are trained and evaluated to find the best performing model. The final model, Gradient Boosting Regressor, shows the highest accuracy in predicting house prices, making it the most reliable model for this task.

* This model can be used by real estate professionals or potential home buyers to estimate the price of a property based on its features, helping to make informed decisions in the real estate market.
